Obvious Error: The obvious error is that the x and y coordinates are not being properly swapped.

Problem Analysis: The function does not correctly handle the swapping of x and y coordinates in the provided numpy array.

coords = np.array([[10, 5, 15, 6, 0],
                   [11, 3, 13, 6, 0],
                   [5, 3, 13, 6, 1],
                   [4, 4, 13, 6, 1],
                   [6, 5, 13, 16, 1]])
swapped_coords = swap(coords)

Solution Approach: Ensure that the function correctly swaps the x and y coordinates in each row of the numpy array.
