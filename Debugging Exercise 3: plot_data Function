Issue Identification: The plot is not showing correctly.

Problem Analysis: There may be an error in how the data is being read from the CSV file or in the plotting function itself.

f = open("data_file.csv", "w")
w = csv.writer(f)
_ = w.writerow(["precision", "recall"])
w.writerows([[0.013,0.951],
             [0.376,0.851],
             ...
             [1.0,0.0]])
f.close()
plot_data('data_file.csv')


Solution Approach: Check for any discrepancies between the data in the CSV file and how it is being plotted.
