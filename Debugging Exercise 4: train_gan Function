Structural Bug: Changing the batch_size from 32 to 64 triggers a ValueError due to a size mismatch.

Cosmetic Bug: There is likely an issue with the formatting or display of the training progress.

Code Example:
train_gan(batch_size=32, num_epochs=100)

Solution Approach: Ensure that the batch size is adjusted appropriately and address any formatting or display issues to improve readability.
